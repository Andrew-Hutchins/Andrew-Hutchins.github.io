<h2>Childhood</h2>
	<p>I grew up in a town called Alna, ME, which has a population of about 800 residents
	in total; thankfully, I had one friend on my block, Noah, so I wasn't completely and outcast.
	I attended the Wiscasset School Systems from Kindergarten to my 8th grade year, then 
	switching over to Lincoln Academy, a private school on the other side of the Sheepscot River. 
	I was upset at the time, but the Wiscasset Schools imploded just as I left, so I suppose
	my parents made the right move. I was an avid football and baseball player from childhood, 
	participating in summer and winter camps for both sports. 

<h2>High School Years</h2>
	<p>Lincoln Academy was a foreign place to me at first, but after my Freshman year I grew
	accustomed to the people and stopped being an introvert. I played high school football 
	and baseball throughout my four years, winning multiple Coach's Awards and earning Captainship
	in the process. I graduated in 2016 and made the transition from Lincoln Academy Eagle to 
	UMaine Blackbear, feeling the same anxiety I felt upon entering high school.</p>
	
<h2>College Life</h3>
	<p> Although my father kept telling me that college was "some of the best years of his life,"
	I did not fully understand him until about a week into college. I found a group of about ten
	friends in my building, Penobscot Hall, whom I live with now in two quads in Colvin Hall. 
	Carl, Anthony, Gerren, Kendall, Cliff, Cormac, and Keith are all guys that I hope to maintain
	friendships with in the coming years, and hopefully for life.</p>
