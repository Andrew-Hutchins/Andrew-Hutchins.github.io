			<h2>Summary</h2>
<div class="Summary">
	<p> I began working unofficial jobs around the age of 12 until I was 16. Such jobs included both
neighbors asking me to babysit their dogs and cats for weeks 
at a time, and landscaping. I  began working for Bailey and Son Painting, a small 
contracting business run by the father of a high school friend, in 2015. 
I worked well with friends and built strong relationships with strangers who I
worked with whilst staying on task and completing my work each day. I worked 
with Bailey & Son Painting during the 2015, 2016, and 2017 summers from May to August 
each year. During my final year of painting, I was able to conduct jobs with a fellow worker
without the presence of our boss, as I had learned how to carry out a job on my own instruction.</p>
